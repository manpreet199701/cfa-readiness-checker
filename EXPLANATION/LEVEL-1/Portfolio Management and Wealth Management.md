# Portfolio Management and Wealth Management (Level I)

## Introduction to Portfolio Management
Portfolio management is the process of selecting and managing investments to meet an investor's long-term financial goals. It involves constructing a portfolio, monitoring its performance, and making adjustments as needed.

### Key Concepts:
* **Asset Allocation:** The process of dividing an investment portfolio among different asset categories, such as stocks, bonds, and cash. This is a crucial step as it determines most of a portfolio's risk and return characteristics.
* **Diversification:** Spreading investments across various asset classes, industries, and geographies to reduce risk. The goal is to minimize unsystematic (company-specific) risk.
* **Risk Tolerance:** An investor's willingness and ability to take on financial risk. This is a key determinant of asset allocation.

## Types of Investors
There are generally two types of investors from a portfolio management perspective:

1.  **Individual Investors:**
    * Often have unique goals (e.g., retirement, house purchase).
    * Face specific constraints (e.g., liquidity needs, time horizon).
    * **Example:** A young professional saving for retirement might have a high risk tolerance and a long time horizon.

2.  **Institutional Investors:**
    * Manage large pools of money for others (e.g., pension funds, endowments, insurance companies).
    * Subject to strict regulations and governance.
    * **Example:** A pension fund has long-term liabilities and typically invests in a diversified portfolio across various asset classes.

## The Investment Policy Statement (IPS)
The IPS is a critical document for both individual and institutional investors. It outlines the investor's objectives, constraints, and investment strategies.

### Components of an IPS:
* **Client Description:** Who is the investor?
* **Purpose:** Why is the IPS being created?
* **Objectives:**
    * **Return Objectives:** Desired percentage return (e.g., inflation-adjusted, absolute).
    * **Risk Objectives:** Investor's risk tolerance (e.g., "willing to accept moderate losses for higher long-term returns").
* **Constraints:**
    * **Liquidity:** Need for cash.
    * **Time Horizon:** Investment period.
    * **Tax Situation:** Tax implications.
    * **Legal & Regulatory:** Any specific rules.
    * **Unique Circumstances:** Any personal preferences or restrictions.
